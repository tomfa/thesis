\chapter{Preface}
This project was carried out as a Masterâ€™s thesis at NTNU as part of the MSc programme in Computer Science during the summer of 2015. The work has been supervised by Monica Divitini and co-supervised by Simone Mora.

The work is in large part motivated by challenges with previous projects done by students of supervisor Monica Divitini when creating hybrid board games. The contributions from the student include the development and design of the AnyBoard library, token drivers and firmware that is located at \href{https://github.com/tomfa/anyboardjs/}{github.com/tomfa/anyboardjs}. Available open source libraries and modules have been used where applicable.

The design and assembly of the arduino-based tokens has been done by co-supervisor Simone Mora.

Thanks to my supervisors for guidance, input and motivation throughout the thesis. You've been great!
